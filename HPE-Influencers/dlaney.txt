For #Infonomics publications (@Gartner_inc and others) and principle details see http://t.co/qRHgn4wFMf.
#Infonomics Principle #7: Manage info as an asset. Apply similar discipline &amp; techniques you do to managing financial &amp; physical assets.
"#Infonomics Principle #6: Use info's value to help budget IT&amp;biz initiatives. Consider its value vs cost to acquire, administer &amp; apply it."
#Infonomics Principle #5: Info's realized value should be maximized. Or more precisely: optimized vs the costs of doing so.
#Infonomics Principle #4: Info should be accounted for as an asset. You can't manage well what you don't measure.
"#Infonomics Principle #3: Info's value can be quantified. Using relativistic &amp; economic methods (i.e. cost, income, market approaches)."
"#Infonomics Principle #2: Info has both potential and realized value. (And ""probable future economic benefit"" per balance sheet assets.)"
