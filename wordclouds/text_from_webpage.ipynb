Although most antibiotic-resistant bacteria originally emerged in hospitals, drug-resistant strains are becoming more common in the community. Factors that facilitate the development of resistance within the community can be categorized as behavioral or environmental/policy. Behavioral factors include inappropriate use of antibiotics and ineffective infection control and hygiene practices. Environmental/policy factors include the continued use of antibiotics in agriculture and the lack of new drug development. A multifaceted approach that includes behavioral strategies in the community and the political will to make difficult regulatory decisions will help to minimize the problem of antimicrobial resistance globally.</p> </div></div><div><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2> <p>The decade of the 1960s was the golden era of antibiotic drug discovery and development, and the eventual eradication of bacterial infections was predicted. Antibiotics were indeed miracle drugs, curing previously lethal infections. Resistance to each new antibiotic, however, has ultimately emerged, usually within a few years after the antibiotic is marketed (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">45</a>). Resistance is inevitable with any new agent developed. Antibiotic resistance will not likely ever be completely prevented because many organisms carry intrinsic resistance mechanisms, which render certain antibiotics useless, and because, even with appropriate use of antimicrobial agents, the need to treat or prevent serious infection may allow the selection and emergence of subpopulations of resistant strains. Nevertheless, an understanding of the factors associated with the development of resistance will help inform clinical practice and policies to maximize the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy.</p> <p>Antibiotic resistance is often described in the context of the health care setting, particularly in hospitals and long-term care facilities, because such settings bring together seriously ill individuals who often require antibiotic therapy, are also in close proximity to each other, and are touched by people who go between them. These factors increase the risk of the emergence and subsequent transmission of resistance within and between patients. In the past decade, antibiotic resistance has been increasingly identified in the community. Although community factors are also important in the spread of resistance (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">11</a>, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">38</a>, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">46</a>, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">49</a>), less attention has been focused on nonhealth care settings. Antimicrobial resistance is not limited to bacteria; resistance to antiviral agents against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for example, has rapidly emerged, as has chloroquine resistance against the parasite that causes malaria. Resistance among viruses, parasites, and fungi, however, will not be discussed in this review. The purposes of this chapter are to examine factors in the community setting associated with antibiotic resistance and to summarize national policy efforts to address the problem.</p><h2>ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN THE COMMUNITY: PREVALENCE AND IMPACT</h2> <p>Although most antibiotic-resistant bacteria originally emerged in hospitals, drug-resistant strains are becoming more common in the community (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">47</a>). Globally, tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, diarrhea, and pneumonia kill more that 10 million persons each year. Even a decade ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) was warning that drug-resistant strains of the infectious agents causing these diseases had rendered ineffective many traditional treatments (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">80</a>). The list of antibiotic-resistant organisms is rapidly expanding.

As noted in a recent Institute of Medicine report, \"microbial resistance threatens to reverse many of the therapeutic miracles of the past half century\" (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">39</a>, p. 2). The fact that bacteria can share resistance genes across species further compounds the problem.</p>  <p>Increasing drug resistance poses two major problems: treatment failures and other costs to the individual and society. Some persons may die of infections due to multiply resistant organisms because previously effective drugs have failed (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">49</a>). Even when alternative drugs are available, they are often more expensive and/or more toxic. Lesser developed countries are disproportionately affected because such drugs may not be available. Treatment failures also mean that individuals are infected for longer periods of time, increasing the risk of transmission within the community. Some individuals may become long-term, chronic carriers of resistant organisms such as MRSA, and spread from asymptomatic carriers in the community occurs (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">39</a>). Finally, some evidence suggests that certain resistant bacterial strains may be more virulent than susceptible strains (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">52</a>).</p><h2>COMMUNITY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE</h2> <p>Factors that facilitate the development of resistance within the community can be categorized as behavioral or environmental/policy.

The timeline for development of a new agent may be 10 years or more, only \\xe2\\x88\\xbc1 in 1000 candidate drugs reach licensure at a cost of $800 million to $1.7 billion per drug, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process is extremely cumbersome, costly, and slow. Then, the life of a drug is limited by relatively short periods before patents expire and by the emergence of resistance, so the return on investment is poor (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">34</a>, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">45</a>, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">61</a>, <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">71</a>).<p>Because of the public health significance of this problem, a number of suggestions have been made to facilitate new drug development (<b><a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">Table 3</a></b>).

Nevertheless, antibiotic prescribing and use patterns and emphasis on improved personal protective and infection-prevention strategies are behavioral factors that can slow the emergence of resistance. Fortunately, several active surveillance systems provide data on resistance so that trends and changes can be monitored and the effectiveness of interventions can be assessed.</p> <p>The environmental and policy factors that contribute to resistance will require regulatory and governmental intervention, and these will require an informed electorate urging legislative action and enforcement. Several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to improve the regulatory climate. Further, an Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance was created in 1999 and is cochaired by the CDC, the FDA, and the National Institutes of Health, and also includes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. Their latest 103-page Inventory of Projects (<b><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/actionplan/2003report/inventory.pdf\" title=\"External link, opens new window\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/actionplan/2003report/inventory.pdf</a></b>) describes multiple efforts to address antimicrobial resistance. Despite these efforts, the U.S. response continues to be inadequate. As has been recently suggested, it may necessitate putting the needs of society as a whole before the needs of an individual with a minor infection and the global protection needs ahead of agricultural trade advantages of one society (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.28.021406.144020?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed#\" target=\"_blank\">26</a>).

Although most antibiotic-resistant bacteria originally emerged in hospitals, drug-resistant strains are becoming more common in the community. Factors that facilitate the development of resistance within the community can be categorized as behavioral or environmental/policy. Behavioral factors include inappropriate use of antibiotics and ineffective infection control and hygiene practices. Environmental/policy factors include the continued use of antibiotics in agriculture and the lack of new drug development. A multifaceted approach that includes behavioral strategies in the community and the political will to make difficult regulatory decisions will help to minimize the problem of antimicrobial resistance globally. INTRODUCTION The decade of the 1960s was the golden era of antibiotic drug discovery and development, and the eventual eradication of bacterial infections was predicted. Antibiotics were indeed miracle drugs, curing previously lethal infections. Resistance to each new antibiotic, however, has ultimately emerged, usually within a few years after the antibiotic is marketed (45). Resistance is inevitable with any new agent developed. Antibiotic resistance will not likely ever be completely prevented because many organisms carry intrinsic resistance mechanisms, which render certain antibiotics useless, and because, even with appropriate use of antimicrobial agents, the need to treat or prevent serious infection may allow the selection and emergence of subpopulations of resistant strains. Nevertheless, an understanding of the factors associated with the development of resistance will help inform clinical practice and policies to maximize the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. Antibiotic resistance is often described in the context of the health care setting, particularly in hospitals and long-term care facilities, because such settings bring together seriously ill individuals who often require antibiotic therapy, are also in close proximity to each other, and are touched by people who go between them. These factors increase the risk of the emergence and subsequent transmission of resistance within and between patients. In the past decade, antibiotic resistance has been increasingly identified in the community. Although community factors are also important in the spread of resistance (11, 38, 46, 49), less attention has been focused on nonhealth care settings. Antimicrobial resistance is not limited to bacteria; resistance to antiviral agents against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for example, has rapidly emerged, as has chloroquine resistance against the parasite that causes malaria. Resistance among viruses, parasites, and fungi, however, will not be discussed in this review. The purposes of this chapter are to examine factors in the community setting associated with antibiotic resistance and to summarize national policy efforts to address the problem.ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE IN THE COMMUNITY: PREVALENCE AND IMPACT Although most antibiotic-resistant bacteria originally emerged in hospitals, drug-resistant strains are becoming more common in the community (47). Globally, tuberculosis, malaria, cholera, diarrhea, and pneumonia kill more that 10 million persons each year. Even a decade ago, the World Health Organization (WHO) was warning that drug-resistant strains of the infectious agents causing these diseases had rendered ineffective many traditional treatments (80). The list of antibiotic-resistant organisms is rapidly expanding. The causative organisms of some important bacterial infections in the community, listed in Table 1, have all developed increasing antimicrobial resistance over the past few decades. For example, community-acquired pneumonia is the sixth most common cause of death in the United States (25) and has historically been treated with penicillin. Penicillin resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae (i.e., pneumococcus) increased from \\xe2\\x88\\xbc5% during the 1980s to 20%\\xe2\\x80\\x9345% by 1997, and resistance to macrolide antibiotics, used to treat penicillin-resistant strains, is increasing globally (35, 38). \"Strep\" throat was treated for years with penicillin, but approximately 45% of Streptococcus pyogenes isolates are now resistant to penicillin and up to one third are also resistant to erythromycin (15, 33). Table 1Emergence of antimicrobial resistance since 1980s among bacteria causing common community infectious diseasesAcute otitis media is the most commonly identified bacterial infection in children, and the majority of young children have several ear infections diagnosed before the age of 7 years. This infection alone is the most common reason for antibiotic prescribing in children (60). Resistance among the primary causative organisms (S. pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) is increasing rapidly (24, 60). Community spread of multiple-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is well documented and has received considerable public media attention (65). Resistant tuberculosis is associated particularly with subpopulations such as the homeless, persons with HIV/AIDS, and persons born in countries with high rates of tuberculosis (22, 30, 57). Even in a healthy community sample of homemakers, antibiotic resistance in hand flora has been reported at a higher-than-expected level (2). Community-acquired methicillin-resis-tant S. aureus (MRSA) has emerged as the causative agent of serious individual cases and outbreaks of skin and soft-tissue infections and sepsis among groups not previously considered to be at high risk (e.g., healthy children, athletes, military recruits) (Figures 1a,b) (13, 14, 51, 67). An estimated 8%\\xe2\\x80\\x9360% of MRSA isolates from hospitals are actually community acquired, depending on the region of the country (27). Although the overall population-based prevalence still seems to be quite low, increasing virulence or other factors have changed the epidemiology of this drug-resistant organism so that it is now recognized as an important community pathogen (29, 67). The prevalence of MRSA in U.S. communities will reach \\xe2\\x88\\xbc25% within the next decade (32). The global impact of antibiotic resistance is potentially devastating, setting back progress against certain infectious diseases to the preantibiotic era; some bacteria are now resistant to as many as 10 antibiotics (Figure 2) (5, 62). As noted in a recent Institute of Medicine report, \"microbial resistance threatens to reverse many of the therapeutic miracles of the past half century\" (39, p. 2). The fact that bacteria can share resistance genes across species further compounds the problem. Increasing drug resistance poses two major problems: treatment failures and other costs to the individual and society. Some persons may die of infections due to multiply resistant organisms because previously effective drugs have failed (49). Even when alternative drugs are available, they are often more expensive and/or more toxic. Lesser developed countries are disproportionately affected because such drugs may not be available. Treatment failures also mean that individuals are infected for longer periods of time, increasing the risk of transmission within the community. Some individuals may become long-term, chronic carriers of resistant organisms such as MRSA, and spread from asymptomatic carriers in the community occurs (39). Finally, some evidence suggests that certain resistant bacterial strains may be more virulent than susceptible strains (52).COMMUNITY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE Factors that facilitate the development of resistance within the community can be categorized as behavioral or environmental/policy. Behavioral factors include antibiotic use and hygiene and infection control practices. Environmental/policy factors include use of antibiotics in animals and the drug development pipeline (Table 2). Several excellent reviews of antibiotic resistance in the community have been published recently, and the reader should refer to these for additional information (28, 32). Table 2Community factors associated with antibiotic resistanceBehavioral Factors Antibiotic use practices.\\xe2\\x80\\x83Antibiotic use in the community has been directly linked to resistance (55). For example, in a survey of urban poor, individuals reporting antibiotic use during the previous 12 months were significantly more likely to be colonized with MRSA (17). Among college-age women attending an emergency clinic, current use of any antibiotic was significantly associated with resistance of urinary tract isolates (82). High antibiotic use in geographically defined areas of Sweden was significantly correlated with the frequency of penicillin-resistant pneumococci isolated from children living in those areas (55). An Icelandic study reported that antibiotic consumption by geographic area and individual use of antibiotics were significantly associated with carriage of resistant strains of pneumococcus (8). Not only is antibiotic resistance prevalent among persons taking antibiotics, but also antibiotic use by one person in close living quarters (e.g., child care centers, military barracks) leads to the transmission and colonization of resistant organisms to others (6, 12). Despite some improvement, antibiotic misuse and overuse continue to be problems (40).Antibiotic misuse occurs in the community either because the clinician prescribes antibiotics inappropriately for viral infections, for infections likely to resolve without treatment, or because an individual self-prescribes antibiotics. Despite the fact that treatment guidelines exist for conditions such as otitis media (19), clinician overprescribing for viral upper respiratory infections continues. Similarly, in large segments of the U.S. population self-medication with antibiotics is common, particularly among those who have immigrated from countries where antibiotics are available without prescription (20, 41, 43). Even when free medical care and drugs were available, for example, Okeke (62) reported that 72% of Nigerian students self-medicated for diarrhea. Eighty percent of them took an antibiotic, and 45% took more than one. Reasons for antibiotic misuse include the perception among clinicians that patients expect an antibiotic, the belief among the public that they can determine when an antibiotic is needed, a belief that antibiotics are useful to treat viral upper respiratory infections, and disincentives and barriers such as access, financial constraints, long waiting periods to see a provider, or a feeling of disrespect from the health care provider (20, 42). Multiple interventions have been conducted to improve clinician prescribing patterns and self-medication with antibiotics within the community (9, 73). Generally, simple educational interventions alone have been unsuccessful unless they include education of both the clinician and the patient, involve interaction between them, and are targeted and adapted to specific populations (73). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has launched a public media campaign to improve the judicious use of antibiotics (Get Smart, http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/), but almost certainly a community-wide, multilevel ecological approach, recognizing the reciprocal influence of individual behavior and environments, will be needed to have a major impact on this problem (78). Hygiene and infection-control practices.\\xe2\\x80\\x83Hygiene plays an important role in the prevention of community spread of resistance because many of the infecting organisms are more common among the indigent and homeless and those who are immunocompromised or in institutional settings such as military camps, prisons, sports teams, and day care centers (37, 53, 59). The common theme seems to be close contact and sharing of towels, toys, clothing, and other fomites. A highly resistant infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recently reported following ear self-piercing (76). Simple infection-control measures to prevent sharing of potentially contaminated items are becoming increasingly important in the prevention of cross-transmission within the community, particularly in crowded settings or when contact items are shared.Theoretical concerns have been raised regarding the widespread use of certain antimicrobial ingredients, particularly triclosan, in over-the-counter products such as soaps, cutting boards, and many other devices for household use (4). In vitro laboratory studies have demonstrated a potential biologic link between triclosan and antibiotic resistance (18, 66). In one recent clinical trial, however, investigators reported no association between triclosan use and increased antibiotic resistance, but they noted that their sample size was small and the duration that triclosan was used was relatively short (3). However, since several recent trials have shown that there appears to be no reduction in risk of infectious disease symptoms when antibacterial soaps are used (44, 50), it may be prudent to emphasize general cleanliness and good personal hygiene rather than promote the use of products labeled antibacterial. Recent reports have demonstrated that companion animals and pets may serve as reservoirs of MRSA, and cross-species sharing of resistant strains from animals such as dogs, cats, and horses has been confirmed (75, 77). This organism joins the ranks of others such as Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, and Escherichia coli, which are now associated with antibiotic-resistant strains in pets or in animals used for food (68, 81). Public health implications are clear: careful hand hygiene when handling pets or farm animals and thorough cooking of meats. For vaccine-preventable bacterial infections, vaccination is the best mechanism to reduce antibiotic resistance by preventing disease requiring antibiotic treatment (32). For example, among children in Maryland following introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, invasive streptococcal infections resistant to erythromycin decreased by >50% and the percentage of penicillin-resistant pneumococci associated with acute otitis media decreased from 73% to 53% (p < 0.02) (54). Similar experiences have been reported in Israel, France, and Spain (64, 69, 79). Multi-drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci are other potential candidates for vaccine development (32). Environmental/Policy Factors Use of antibiotics in agriculture.\\xe2\\x80\\x83Although the use of antibiotics in animals to treat infection is necessary (70), the indiscriminant use of antibiotics among animals and in agriculture is one factor in the spread of antibiotic resistance and has serious public health consequences (5, 7). At least 17 classes of antibiotics are approved for animal feed and growth promotion in the United States (7). Despite recommendations from the WHO (10) and the U.S. Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance (http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/actionplan/index.htm), thousands of tons of antibiotics are still used annually in the U.S. agricultural industry (47). Multiple studies have demonstrated that exposure to animals who have been fed antibiotics, either by direct contact or through the food chain, results in human colonization and sometimes serious, life-threatening infection with the same or related drug-resistant strains (36, 48, 58). Use of antimicrobials in food animals has been a subject of discussion for 30 years (70). Several decades ago the use of antibiotics as growth promoters was banned in Sweden (31) and has been similarly banned in a number of other European countries. The ban in Denmark has resulted in a 60% reduction in antibiotic use among animals (72); across Europe the discontinuation of antibiotics as animal growth promotants has been accompanied by a decrease in antibiotic resistance in animals, foods, and humans without any detectable negative impact on profits or animal health (1, 74). The disturbing issue is that the United States has been slow to enact and enforce similar regulations.Drug development pipeline.\\xe2\\x80\\x83Even if the use of antibiotics were entirely appropriate, resistance would still occur (23). Hence, the continued development of new pharmaceuticals and antimicrobial agents is essential. Unfortunately, development of new antibacterial agents has slowed consistently over the past few decades (Figure 3); of 89 new drugs under development in 2002, none were antibiotics (34). Although scholars agree that development of new antimicrobials is vital in light of increasing resistance (45, 61), major disincentives exist. The timeline for development of a new agent may be 10 years or more, only \\xe2\\x88\\xbc1 in 1000 candidate drugs reach licensure at a cost of $800 million to $1.7 billion per drug, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process is extremely cumbersome, costly, and slow. Then, the life of a drug is limited by relatively short periods before patents expire and by the emergence of resistance, so the return on investment is poor (34, 45, 61, 71).Because of the public health significance of this problem, a number of suggestions have been made to facilitate new drug development (Table 3). Many of these potential facilitators, however, would require congressional action and federal involvement, so the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that concerned professionals and citizens help to make this issue visible to policy makers (34). Table 3Recommendations to facilitate development of new antimicrobial agents (11, 56, 61)SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is inevitable. Nevertheless, antibiotic prescribing and use patterns and emphasis on improved personal protective and infection-prevention strategies are behavioral factors that can slow the emergence of resistance. Fortunately, several active surveillance systems provide data on resistance so that trends and changes can be monitored and the effectiveness of interventions can be assessed. The environmental and policy factors that contribute to resistance will require regulatory and governmental intervention, and these will require an informed electorate urging legislative action and enforcement. Several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to improve the regulatory climate. Further, an Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance was created in 1999 and is cochaired by the CDC, the FDA, and the National Institutes of Health, and also includes the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. Their latest 103-page Inventory of Projects (http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/actionplan/2003report/inventory.pdf) describes multiple efforts to address antimicrobial resistance. Despite these efforts, the U.S. response continues to be inadequate. As has been recently suggested, it may necessitate putting the needs of society as a whole before the needs of an individual with a minor infection and the global protection needs ahead of agricultural trade advantages of one society (26). A multifaceted approach that includes behavioral strategies in the community and the political will to make difficult regulatory decisions will help to minimize the problem of antimicrobial resistance globally. acknowledgments In collaboration with The Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (CIRAR), http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/dept/nursing/CIRAR/, funded by The National Center for Research Resources, P20 RR020616. literature cited Aarestrup FM, Seyfarth AM, Emborg HD, Pedersen K, Hendriksen RS, Bager F. 2001.
